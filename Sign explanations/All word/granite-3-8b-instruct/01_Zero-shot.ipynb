It's located on a rock in the harbor, and while it's small, it's a must-see for any visitor.\\n\\n2. **Tivoli Gardens**: This amusement park is one of the oldest in the world and offers a delightful mix of rides, gardens, and entertainment. It's especially magical at night when the lights come on.\\n\\n3. **Christiania**: This self-proclaimed autonomous neighborhood is known for its colorful houses, alternative lifestyle, and the famous Pusher Street, which sells cannabis (though it's technically illegal).\\n\\n4. **Nyhavn**: This picturesque harbor is lined with colorful 17th-century townhouses, charming cafes, and restaurants. It's a great place to enjoy a drink or a meal while watching the boats\",\n",

The tossing motion should be small and gentle.  You can think of it as mixing or tossing the ingredients of a salad together.  The sign is meant to be a visual representation of the action of making a salad.  To make the sign clear, keep your fingers together and your palm down.  This will help you to convey the sign effectively.  Practice the sign a few times to get a feel for the movement.  As you practice, focus on keeping your hand loose and relaxed.  With a little practice, you should be able to sign 'salad' clearly and confidently.  You are now signing 'salad'.  You can use this sign to talk about your favorite salad or to order a salad at a restaurant.  You can also use it to describe a healthy meal or to talk about your eating habits.
